# Final_project



TODO:

- Bare bones login/logout function (DONE)
- instead of sending you to an apology page, figure out how to display the text on the login/register screen when user makes an error, so they can re-type it without having to restart the website (may need javascript) 
- create homepage layout (DONE)
- Make the buttons functional (DONE)
- finish flashcard shuffle function (Darasimi)
- create table for flashcards
- find a way to insert the flashcards into the table
- make sure each flashcard table is connected only to the specfic user (user_id will likely be used here. Somehow.)
- Interface/layout for flashcards where user can click on them. May resort to links temporarily 
- Way for user to type into a "flash card". Will need a form, but with a very different looking textbox
